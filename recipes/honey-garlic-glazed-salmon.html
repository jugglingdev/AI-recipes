                <ul>
                    <li>4 salmon fillets (about 6 ounces each), skin-on</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Honey Garlic Glaze</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
                </ul>
                
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
                <li>Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add the salmon fillets to the skillet, skin-side down. Sear for 3-4 minutes, or until the skin is crispy and golden brown.</li>
                <li>Flip the salmon fillets over and transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.</li>
                <li>While the salmon is baking, prepare the honey garlic glaze. In a small saucepan, combine the honey, soy sauce, minced garlic, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and water to create a slurry. Slowly pour the slurry into the honey garlic mixture while whisking constantly.</li>
                <li>Cook the glaze for 2-3 minutes, or until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon.</li>
                <li>When the salmon is done baking, remove it from the oven and brush the honey garlic glaze on top of each fillet. Place the skillet back in the oven and broil on high for 1-2 minutes, or until the glaze is caramelized and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Remove the salmon from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
                <li>Serve the salmon with your favorite sides, like rice and steamed vegetables.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
