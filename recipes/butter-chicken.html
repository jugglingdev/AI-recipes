        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, garam masala, turmeric powder, cumin powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken cubes and toss to coat evenly. Marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours in the fridge.</li>
                <li>Heat ghee or butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add ginger paste, garlic paste, garam masala, turmeric powder, cumin powder, and paprika. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
                <li>Add the marinated chicken to the skillet and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
                <li>Pour the crushed tomatoes into the skillet and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.</li>
                <li>Add the heavy cream to the sauce and stir until well combined. Add the cooked chicken back to the skillet and stir to coat evenly. Simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until the chicken is heated through and the sauce is thick and creamy.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with steamed rice, naan bread, or your favorite side dishes. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.</li>
