## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This project was originally designed for random recipes pulled from the internet.  The sudden rise in AI technology gave me inspiration to revisit this project and throw in a twist.

All recipes were provided by ChatGPT.  Even the catch phrase "Brought to you by ChatGPT, cooking up knowledge and flavor one dish at a time!" was produced by infamous chatbot.

### Useful resources
